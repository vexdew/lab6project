            <h1>Objects in Dart</h1>
            <p>
                This lab focused on exploring the use of objects in Dart programming and their role in enhancing modularity and functionality in Flutter applications. It also contrasted the use of objects with Dart's `Future` for handling asynchronous programming.
            </p>

            <p><strong>Key Topics Covered:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Definition and purpose of objects in Dart programming.</li>
                <li>Comparison between objects and `Future` for asynchronous operations.</li>
                <li>Advantages and limitations of using objects in Dart.</li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>Key Insights:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Objects encapsulate data and behavior, serving as foundational components for structured, reusable code in Dart.</li>
                <li>In contrast, `Future` enables asynchronous programming, handling delayed responses and preventing thread blocking in applications.</li>
                <li>Practical example: Using objects to manage user profiles in an academic app while leveraging `Future` to fetch data from APIs asynchronously.</li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>Advantages:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Supports modular and reusable code for scalable applications.</li>
                <li>Provides enhanced organization by separating UI components and logic into classes.</li>
                <li>Features null safety to reduce errors caused by null references, improving reliability.</li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>Limitations:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Verbose syntax for simple operations, requiring class definitions even for minimal elements.</li>
                <li>Single inheritance constraint, limiting flexibility in complex hierarchies.</li>
                <li>Potential performance overhead with excessive object creation in resource-constrained environments.</li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>Practical Application:</strong></p>
            <p>
                A student management app for an academic institution utilized Record objects to encapsulate data like name, student ID, GPA, and academic status. These objects streamlined data handling and ensured scalability for adding new features like scholarship eligibility checks.
            </p>

            <p><strong>Reflection:</strong></p>
            <p>
                This lab deepened my understanding of Dart's object-oriented principles and how they complement Flutter’s framework to create dynamic, responsive applications. By contrasting objects with `Future`, I gained insights into optimizing both synchronous and asynchronous processes in app development.
